# 🚗 Automatic Gate Unlocking System using Car Number Plate Recognition

This Python-based system uses OpenCV and Tesseract OCR to detect and recognize license plates of vehicles in real-time. If the detected number plate matches one in the authorized list, the gate is automatically unlocked. It simulates a smart security system for residential societies, offices, and parking zones.
